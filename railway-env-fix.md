# üö® CRITICAL FIX: Railway Environment Variables

## The Problem
Your Telegram bot is not responding because `NODE_ENV=development` in your local .env file, but Railway needs `NODE_ENV=production` to use webhook mode.

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard
1. Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your project: `ewhoreweb`
3. Go to **Variables** tab

### Step 2: Set These Environment Variables
```
NODE_ENV=production
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8463521309:AAG7QJZotBBpkTD0YoSztC8rSM1_pI29tqM
BASE_URL=https://ewhoreweb.up.railway.app
PORT=8080
```

### Step 3: Verify Other Variables
Make sure these are also set:
```
PLISIO_SECRET_KEY=your_plisio_secret_key
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. After setting variables, Railway will automatically redeploy
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
3. Test the bot by sending `/start` to @EwhoreAssistantbot

## üîç Verification
Run this command to test after deployment:
```bash
node test-webhook-direct.js
```

## üéØ Expected Result
- Webhook endpoint should return 200 OK
- Bot should respond to `/start` command
- No more 404 errors
