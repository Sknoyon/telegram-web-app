# üö® RAILWAY EMERGENCY FIX GUIDE

## CRITICAL ISSUE
Your Railway deployment is completely broken. Health endpoints work but all application routes return 404.

## üî• IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your project: `ewhoreweb`
3. Click on **"Deployments"** tab
4. Look for failed deployments (red X marks)

### Step 2: Check Build Logs
1. Click on the latest deployment
2. Look for **"Build Logs"** section
3. Check for any error messages during build
4. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Syntax errors
   - Environment variable issues

### Step 3: Check Runtime Logs
1. In Railway dashboard, go to **"Logs"** tab
2. Look for server startup messages
3. Check if you see: `üöÄ Simple Server started successfully!`
4. If not, look for error messages

### Step 4: Verify Environment Variables
Go to **"Variables"** tab and ensure these are set:

```
NODE_ENV=production
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8463521309:AAG7QJZotBBpkTD0YoSztC8rSM1_pI29tqM
BASE_URL=https://ewhoreweb.up.railway.app
PORT=8080
```

### Step 5: Check Start Command
1. Go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Look for **"Start Command"**
3. It should be: `node server-simple.js`
4. If it's different, change it and redeploy

### Step 6: Manual Redeploy
1. In Railway dashboard, click **"Deploy"** button
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Check logs for any errors

## üîç DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

### If Build Fails:
- [ ] Check package.json syntax
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are listed
- [ ] Look for missing files

### If Runtime Fails:
- [ ] Check environment variables
- [ ] Look for database connection errors
- [ ] Verify start command

### If Routes Don't Work:
- [ ] Check if server is starting
- [ ] Verify port configuration
- [ ] Look for middleware errors

## üöÄ EXPECTED RESULTS

After fixing, you should see:

1. **Build Logs**: ‚úÖ Build completed successfully
2. **Runtime Logs**: ‚úÖ `üöÄ Simple Server started successfully!`
3. **Health Check**: ‚úÖ https://ewhoreweb.up.railway.app/health returns 200
4. **Webhook**: ‚úÖ https://ewhoreweb.up.railway.app/webhook returns 200
5. **Store**: ‚úÖ https://ewhoreweb.up.railway.app/store loads

## üÜò IF NOTHING WORKS

### Nuclear Option - Fresh Deploy:
1. Delete current Railway service
2. Create new Railway service
3. Connect to GitHub repo
4. Set environment variables
5. Deploy

### Alternative - Local Test:
```bash
node server-simple.js
```
If this works locally but not on Railway, it's a Railway configuration issue.

## üìû WHAT TO REPORT

If you need help, provide:
1. Railway build logs (copy/paste)
2. Railway runtime logs (copy/paste)
3. Environment variables list (hide sensitive values)
4. Current start command setting

**The simplified server should fix the routing issues. If it doesn't work, the problem is in Railway configuration, not the code.**
